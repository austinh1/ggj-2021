# Unfinished Business - Global Game Jam 2021

This is a game! Team Ghosty Boi made it for the IGDA Cincinnati location. It was a collaboration among Austin Huebner, Brendan Dickinson, Michael Kirkpatrick, Tyler Cook, Eric Michalski, Clayton Belcher, Sam Tribble, Sam Bricking, and Tanner Howell. It's an online top-down game made in Unity in just 48 hours! You'll need friends to play. If you're a human, slap all the ghosts. If you're a ghost, find all the keys and get the sandwich!

Please enjoy learning whatever you can from this source!
